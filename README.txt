CSCI445 Team Assignment 1

Project name: Bomberman

Team members:
-Alex Beaman
-Christopher Lee
-Kyle Tucker

CSS3 features used:
-Rounded borders
-Box shadows
-Color gradients

JavaScript libraries used:
-jQuery (Intro dialog box)

Other nifty features (that justify the 100 point mark)
-Fairly cool (and complex) game - requires a lot of things happening simultaneously
-Relatively involved board drawing (similar to Clue from CSCI306)
-Lots of images to improve aesthetic appeal (scoreboard, spritesheets)
-Powerups and scoring make for more interesting gameplay
-Several sets of asynchronous clocks (game clock, bomb detonation clock, powerup clock, etc)
